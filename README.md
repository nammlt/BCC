# Comparative EEG Responses to Reward and Loss in  Three armed bandit Gambling Tasks
## About the project
I found that 77% of Thai people have reported engaging in gambling at least once in their lives, with one of the most popular forms being the lottery, commonly known as “หวย” in Thai. Additionally, some Thai people are addicted to playing the lottery every round. It make me curious about how the brain works when playing gambling and what makes people addicted. 

So this project explores how the brain responds differently to reward (winning) and loss outcomes (losing), focusing on specific brain wave responses known as event-related potentials (ERPs), such as Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN) and Reward Positivity (Rew-P). I will use MNE to visualize graphs that compare these responses.  

## Getting Started
I did this project in Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index to share it with my TAs, P'Pung and P'Ong, for assistance.
