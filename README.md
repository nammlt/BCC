# Comparative EEG Responses to Reward and Loss in  Three armed bandit Gambling Tasks
This project explores how the brain responds differently to reward (winning) and loss outcomes (losing), focusing on specific brain wave responses known as event-related potentials (ERPs), such as Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN) and Reward Positivity (Rew-P). I will use MNE to visualize graphs that compare these responses.
